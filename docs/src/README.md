# Lens Map üå± üó∫Ô∏è

A map app based on Lens Protocol. Follow & Collect modules are gated by location, represented by a ERC1155 token.

## Map (ERC1155)
- The entire (-90 to 90) latitudes and (0 to 180E & 180W) longitudes are split into a configurable & predictible amount of locations
- A base `_move` function can be used to burn old location token & mint the new location token
